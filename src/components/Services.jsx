              <p>
                My mobile app development process begins with a comprehensive
                analysis of your projectâ€™s requirements and objectives. I then
                develop a strategy and design a prototype, followed by the
                development phase. Once the app is ready, I'll perform
                comprehensive testing and optimization to ensure a high-quality
                user experience.
